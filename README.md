# Track your needs
The App lets you keep track of your basic needs: sleep, social life, nutrition and sport. 

By filling in your needs daily and seeing a weekly overview you notice which needs to take better care of. 

If a need is fulfilled the correlating need bar is green but if you, for example, don't get enough sleep the bar turns red.
